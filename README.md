NUHire
NUHire is a React web application made for Northeastern Khoury College students hoping to further understand and learn more about the hiring process. NUHire has two diffrent user interfaces based on how a user is registered. If a user regesters as a student they recive the student perspective of the web app. The student when logged in is taken to a dashboard wich provideds instructions on how to navigate them through the web app. The other user interface is if the user registers as an advisor. As an advisor you can edit what groups students are in and what job description they view when they get to reviewing the job description. An advisor can also upload and delete stored resumes and job descriptions for future use. Lastly the advisor is able to send out popup notifications to the students in specific groups.

## PREWRITEN GOTTEN FROM USING REACT
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
